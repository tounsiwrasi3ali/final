          <h1>About us</h1>
          <hr>
          <p>I’m passionate about motorbikes, dirt bikes, cars, racing sports and going on adventures and road tips. If you are like me and like the off-road lifestyle and extreme sports, you came to the right place.

            I’ve created TOUNSI RIDER to help beginners get started with this adventurous hobby. Whether you are interested in buying a dirt bike, ATV, motorcycle or other two or four wheel vehicles, at Tounsi Rider you will find the information you are looking for.
            
            To help beginners and enthusiasts, I try to cover a wide range of topics, such as:</p>
            
           <li> Product Reviews</li>
           <li> Buying Guides</li>
           <li>  How-to Guides</li>
           <li>  Safety Guides</li>
           <li>   Beginner’s Guide</li>
           <li> and a lot more…</li>
           <p> You are here because want to get started with dirt biking, or want to become a professional dirt bike racer? Maybe you want to buy a vehicle and don’t know if a dirt bike or ATV would be a better choice? Probably you want to know how to make motorcycle riding safer? I highly recommend starting out with the linked guides, before you commit buying something.
